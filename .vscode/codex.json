Identify circular includes, unnecessary includes, headers that fail to include what they use, and any shared files that include board-specific headers. Provide: (1) a high-level summary, (2) file-by-file findings, and (3) a concrete refactor checklist I can follow. Do not modify any files, only report findings."

Copy the existing structure (platformio.ini, src/main.cpp, src/BoardConfig.cpp, include/BoardPins.h, data/). Update platformio.ini with the correct PlatformIO board ID, and adjust BoardPins.h and BoardConfig.cpp wiring for the new hardware (display, touch, SD, sensors as described by the user). Keep all hardware-specific details inside the new board folder and do not modify shared code."

First, analyze the repository structure, then propose a brief plan. Apply changes in small, coherent steps and output diff-style patches. Respect the rules that shared code must remain board-agnostic and board wiring stays in boards/<board> only."
